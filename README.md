# WEBdeLDN: Code of Conduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our meetup are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.


## TL;DR:

***Be excellent with each other*** (a.k.a. "Donâ€™t be a Jerk")

## The Quick Version

Our meetup is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.

We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any meetup venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup without a refund at the discretion of the organisers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of meetup staff immediately. The staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.

The staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meetup. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules during the meetup and and the meetup-related social events.

## Reporting violations

We take our code of conduct seriously! Please report any potential violations to one of the organizers in person or send an email to [webdeldn@gmail.com](mailto:webdeldn@gmail.com).

All complaints will be investigated immediately. If the person reporting the incident wishes, the organizers will provide updates how how the complaint is being dealt with.
